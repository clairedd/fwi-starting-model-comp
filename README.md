Figure Plotting and Data Download Codes for "Comparing Adjoint Waveform Tomography Models of California Using Different Starting Models."

Final model files can be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7830683) in both NetCDF format (readable with *xarray*, [Hoyer and Hamman, 2017](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.148)) and HDF5 format (readable with *Paraview*, [Ahrens et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123875822500381?via%3Dihub), and *Salvus*, [Afanasiev et al., 2019](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/216/3/1675/5174970)). All three starting models are available on the IRIS EMC: CSEM_NA ([Krischer et al., 2018](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-csem_north_america/)), SPiRaL ([Simmons et al., 2021](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-spiral_14/)), and WUS256 ([Rodgers et al., 2022](http://ds.iris.edu/ds/products/emc-wus256/)).
